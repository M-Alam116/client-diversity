        Many know client diversity is important for a more resilient network,
        but they don&apos;t understand why or just how essential it is.
        It&apos;s not only important â€”{" "}
        <span className="font-[700]">it&apos;s critical.</span> If a single
        client is used by 2/3rds (66%) of validators, there&apos;s a very real
        risk this can result in disrupting the chain and monetary loss [

      <p className="font-[400] text-[15px]">
        It takes 2/3rds of validators to reach finality. If a client with 66%+
        of marketshare has a bug and forks to its own chain, it&lsquo;ll be
        capable of finalizing. Once the fork finalizes, the{" "}
        <span className="font-[700]">
          validators cannot return to the real chain without being slashed.
        </span>{" "}
        If 66% of the chain gets slashed simultaneously, the penalty is the
        whole 32 ETH.

      <p className="font-[400] text-[15px]">
        So why is {">"}50% marketshare still dangerous? If a minority client
        forks, the 50%+ majority client can obtain a 66%+ majority. With no
        client having a marketshare over 33%, these scenarios are avoided.
        That&lsquo;s why{" "}
